# Seaborn

Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data.It is often used because it makes attractive visualizations and works easily with Pandas. While in Matplotlib you often had to write multiple lines of code to create a plot Seaborn makes assumptions on what you want which often translates into getting the same plot with 1 line of code. Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots. Its dataset-oriented, declarative API lets you focus on what the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details of how to draw them.

You can install it using the Anaconda Environment tab, or by executing the following in your terminal pip install seaborn or conda install seaborn.
